    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "- Server shows \"Waiting for data...\" forever\n",
    "- No \"SERVER RECEIVED DATA!\" messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Cluster Heads:**\n",
    "   - Are they showing \"Forwarded to SERVER\" messages?\n",
    "   - If NO → Go to Problem 2\n",
    "   - If YES → Server network issue\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Server IP:**\n",
    "   - Server Config → FastEthernet0\n",
    "   - Must be: **192.168.1.1**\n",
    "   - Subnet: **255.255.255.0**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Server Code:**\n",
    "   - Port must be **5000**\n",
    "   - Look for: `socket.begin(5000)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Verify Cable:**\n",
    "   - Server to AccessPoint cable connected?\n",
    "   - Green lights on both ends?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Reconfigure server IP\n",
    "- Reconnect ethernet cable\n",
    "- Restart server script\n",

    "### Problem 2: Cluster Head Not Receiving from Members\n",
    "\n",
    "**Symptoms:**\n",
    "- CH shows \"Waiting for Member...\" forever\n",
    "- No \"Received from...\" messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Members:**\n",
    "   - Are members showing \"Packet X sent\" messages?\n",
    "   - If NO → Go to Problem 3\n",
    "   - If YES → Network routing issue\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Member Target IP:**\n",
    "   - Member code must target correct CH IP\n",
    "   - Example: Member1-1 → **192.168.1.100** (CH1)\n",
    "   - Example: Member2-1 → **192.168.1.110** (CH2)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify CH Port:**\n",
    "   - CH1 listens on **5001**\n",
    "   - CH2 listens on **5002**\n",
    "   - CH3 listens on **5003**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Wireless Connections:**\n",
    "   - All MCUs show green wireless lines?\n",
    "   - AccessPoint in range?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Fix member target IPs in code\n",
    "- Move MCUs closer to AccessPoint\n",

    "- Member console shows no output\n",
    "- Or shows errors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis Steps:**\n",

    "1. **Check Sensor Connection:**\n",
    "   - Sensor connected to MCU?\n",
    "   - Cable connected to **D0 pin**?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verify Member IP:**\n",
    "   - Member has static IP configured?\n",
    "   - IP matches code comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Code Deployment:**\n",
    "   - Correct code for this member?\n",
    "   - Code saved (green checkmark)?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Look for Errors:**\n",
    "   - \"NameError\"? Missing import\n",

    "| `No output at all` | Code not running | Click Run button |\n",
    "| `Connection refused` | Wrong target IP | Check CH IP in code |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Verify sensor connection\n",
    "- Re-check IP configuration\n",
    "- Redeploy correct code\n",

    "- Some clusters not reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify Silent Cluster:**\n",
    "   - Which CH number is 0?\n",
    "   - Check that Cluster Head\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check That Cluster's Members:**\n",
    "   - Are both members running?\n",
    "   - Are they sending to correct CH IP?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify CH Listening Port:**\n",
    "   - Each CH has unique port\n",
    "   - No port conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Start missing member nodes\n",
    "- Verify target IPs in member code\n",

    "\n",
    "**Cause:**\n",
    "- CH waiting for BOTH members before forwarding\n",
    "- Only one member is sending\n",
    "\n",
    "**Diagnosis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check BOTH members of that cluster are running\n",
    "2. Verify both members target the SAME CH IP and port\n",
    "3. Look at CH console - does it show \"Received from\" for both?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
